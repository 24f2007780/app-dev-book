## Platform: Web-based

| **Aspect / Feature**     | **Desktop Applications**                     | **Mobile Applications**                                        | **Web Applications**                           |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Execution Model**      | Standalone applications installed on a PC    | Network-oriented apps that frequently communicate with servers | runs inside a browser     |
| **Examples**             | MS Word, Photoshop, VLC Media Player         | Instagram, Google Maps                               | Gmail, Google Docs, YouTube                    |
| **Data Storage**         | Mostly local storage + optional network sync *Excel* | Limited local storage (like *WhatsApp chats synced to cloud*)    | Mostly server-side storage (CLOUD datacenters *Google Drive*)       |
| **Hardware Constraints** | High CPU, memory, disk available             | Limited screen, battery, memory, processing power              | Depends on server power, client is lightweight |
| **SDK/ Development**             | OS-specific  Windows SDK, macOS Cocoa                     | OS-specific Android SDK, Flutter or cross-platform                                          | across OS & devices: React, Vue, Django, Flask                      |

::: details SDK Software Development Kits
- **Libraries/APIs** → Ready-made code you can reuse instead of writing everything from scratch.
- **Compiler/build tools** → turn your source code into runnable programs.
- **Debuggers** → To find and fix errors.
- **Documentation + Examples →** To guide you on how to use the tools.
- **Emulators / Simulators** → Let you test apps without real devices (Android SDK has phone emulator).
