:::tip **Web server**: 
 - Listen for incoming requests on a **fixed port**→ Respond
 - OS manages ports and network connections
:::

:::tip **Protocol** defines: 
- What should client can ask server?
- How the server respond to client?
*How to format packets, place them on wire, headers/checksums*
:::

## HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
- Rulebook for communication between browser and server
- **Client requests server** for some data -> read result -> process
- **Server sends response** with Headers + Body
- **Response Header**: contains
  - acceptable content types client can deal with
  - language
  - encoding
  - cache info
  - status codes

| Method     | Meaning      | Simple Example |
| ---------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| **GET**    | Ask for data | Open a webpage, search queries |
| **POST**   | Send data    | Submit a form, upload files  |
| **PUT**    | Update data  | Edit user profile   |
| **DELETE** | Remove data  | Delete account |

You will learn about *HTTP methods* in greater detail in [Week 6](./6-Rest-APIs.md)

## Transmission Control Protocol
TCP uses 16-bit unsigned integers for port numbers
- This allows values from 0 to 65,535 ($2^{16 \text{ bits}}-1$). 

#### Ports
::: info Port 0 is reserved
If you try to bind with port 0, Operating System automatically assigns a random free port.
:::

#### IP Address
- Unique number to every device on a network
- IPv4: `192.168.1.1` 
  - 4 numbers 
  - in range 0–255, separated by dots
  - Size: `32` bits = 4 Bytes
- Assigned temporarily using DHCP when your device boots
- IPv6
  - Size: `128` bits
  - Written as 8 groups of 16-bit hexadecimal numbers
  - Created due to IPv4 address shortage

::: details ❓ An IPv4 address is given as: `172.16.10.25`<br>Each IPv4 octet is first converted to hexadecimal and then combined pairwise to form an IPv6-style address using 4 hexadecimal digits per group.<br>How will the above IPv4 address be represented in IPv6-style hexadecimal notation?<br>A) `AC10:0A19:0000:0000`<br>B) `0000:0000:AC10:0A19`<br>C) `AC10:190A:0000:0000`<br>D) `0000:AC10:0A19:0000`<br>
$$
\begin{align}
&\textbf{Given IPv4 address: } 172.16.10.25 \\
&\textbf{Step 1: Convert each IPv4 octet from decimal to hexadecimal} \\
&172_{10} = (10 \times 16 + 12) = AC_{16} \\
&16_{10} = (1 \times 16 + 0) = 10_{16} \\
&10_{10} = (0 \times 16 + 10) = 0A_{16} \\
&25_{10} = (1 \times 16 + 9) = 19_{16} \\
&\textbf{Step 2: Group hexadecimal values pairwise (16 bits per group)} \\
&(AC,,10) \rightarrow AC10, \quad (0A,,19) \rightarrow 0A19 \\
&\textbf{Step 3: Pad remaining groups with zeros to match IPv6 format} \\
&\text{IPv6-style representation } = 0000:0000:AC10:0A19
\end{align}
$$


Correct Answer: B) `0000:0000:AC10:0A19`

::: details TCP, UDP, Proxy, Peer-to-Peer, Broadcast, Unicast, Multicast
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between devices on a network through handshakes and acknowledgements.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** is a connectionless protocol that sends data without establishing a prior connection, prioritizing speed over reliability and not guaranteeing delivery.
- **Proxy** acts as an intermediary server between clients and other servers to facilitate requests, improving security, performance, or anonymity.
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)** is a decentralized communication model where each device can act as both client and server, sharing resources directly without central servers.
- **Broadcast** is a one-to-all communication where data is sent from one sender to all devices on a network segment simultaneously.
- **Unicast** is a one-to-one communication where data is sent from one sender to a single specific receiver.
- **Multicast** is a one-to-many communication where data is sent from one sender to multiple specified receivers who join a multicast group, optimizing bandwidth usage.
