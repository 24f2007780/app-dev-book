## Client ↔ Server Architecture

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Network
    participant Server

    Client->>Network: HTTP Request (GET / POST)
    Network->>Server: Forward request (doesn't modify)

    Server-->>Network: provides HTTP Response (data & status)
    Network-->>Client: Deliver response

    Note over Client: User interaction, display
    Note over Server: Stores data & perform computations
    Note over Network: Connects client to server (can be local)
```


- **Machine Client**: may run without direct user interaction, e.g. software/antivirus updaters running in the *background*.
- **Local Systems**: both client & server run on same machine like *browser accessing a local database or `localhost` web server.*
- **Stateless Requests**: The server does not remember previous HTTP requests unless extra mechanisms like sessions, cookies, or tokens are used.

::: info throughout this course we will be primarily learning about client-server architecture with HTTP protocol

## Distributed or peer-to-peer Architecture

- All peers are considered "**equivalent**" so no permanent central controller
  - If a peer fails⚠️-> automatically re-selects✅ another peer
  - The system keeps working even if some peers go offline
- Shared information and resources among **peers**
- Ex: *bittorrent, Blockchain, Distributed file systems*

:::info When you download a movie using a torrent:
- You download small pieces of the movie from many users
- At the same time, you upload the pieces you already have to others<br>

So, every downloader also becomes an uploader (Data can flow in both ways)

::: details Design Pattern
A general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. 
- Designers observe patterns → reuse same codes for faster development
