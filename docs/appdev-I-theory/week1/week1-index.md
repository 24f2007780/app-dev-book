# Week 1
In this week, we introduce the fundamentals of **applications**—what an app is, its usual components & different platforms on which apps run.<br>
We then study **architectures** like Client-Server & Peer-to-peer, followed by the basics of **computer networks**.<br>

Finally, we explore how the Internet🌐 works by understanding evolution of different networking `protocols`  especially **TCP/IP** and **HTTP**, and why concepts like **latency** and **bandwidth** are critical for real-world systems and exams 

Here are the topics covered in this week:
1. [Introduction to Apps](1-intro-to-applications.md)
2. [Types of Architecture](1-types-architecture.md)
3. [Network History: TCP/IP, HTTP Protocols](1-network-history-TCP.md)
4. ⚠️[Latency Bandwidth](1-latency-bandwidth.md) is essential for numericals in exams
