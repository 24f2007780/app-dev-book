# Week 1

<SessionResources :week="1" />

In this week, we introduce the fundamentals of **applications**: what an app is, its usual components & different platforms on which apps run.<br>
We then study **architectures** like Client-Server & Peer-to-peer.

Finally, we explore how the Internet🌐 works by understanding evolution of different networking `protocols`  especially **TCP/IP**-**HTTP**, and why concepts like **latency**-**bandwidth** are critical for real-world systems and exams
