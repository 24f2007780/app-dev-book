# Week3

This week focuses on the **Presentation Layer** i.e. the **View** in a web application.

This week answers a critical question:
> **How does dynamic data get displayed to users in a meaningful and interactive way?**

You will learn how servers generate dynamic content using **templates**, how strings are formatted and injected safely into HTML, and how templating engines separate **CONTROLLER logic from presentation VIEW**. 

Also understand usability and accessibility considerations for user-facing views
