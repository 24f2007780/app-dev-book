# Presentation Layer (VIEW)
responsible for **displaying data to the user** and capturing user interactions.

- User-interface of application
- Defines how information (received from Controller/Model) is presented (not how it is stored/processed)
- responsible for **displaying data to the user** and capturing user interactions.
- Ex: `HTML pages, server-side templates, Forms, rendered Charts`


## [Usability Heuristics ](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)

These are **design guidelines** applied during UI/UX design decisions.

1. **Visibility of System Status:** Always keep users informed about what is happening through timely & clear feedback.
2. **Match Between System & the Real World:** Use language, concepts, & conventions familiar to users; avoid jargon & follow real-world logic.
3. **User Control & Freedom:** Provide easy ways for users to undo or exit unwanted actions, giving them a sense of control.
4. **Consistency & Standards:** Follow platform & industry conventions so users don’t have to wonder if different words or actions mean the same thing.
5. **Error Prevention:** Design to prevent errors before they occur, rather than just relying on good error messages.
6. **Recognition Rather Than Recall:** Minimize memory load by making options, actions, & information visible & easily accessible.
7. **Flexibility & Efficiency of Use:** Allow both novices & experts to use the system efficiently, offering shortcuts & customization for frequent users.
8. **Aesthetic & Minimalist Design:** Keep interfaces simple & uncluttered, showing only relevant information & elements.
9. **Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, & Recover from Errors:** Use plain language in error messages, clearly indicate problems, & suggest solutions.
10. **Help & Documentation:** Provide easy-to-search, concise help & documentation focused on user tasks, available when needed.


## Accessibility
Accessibility guidelines are defined by the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)**. Can be summarized as **POUR** acronym:

<div class="card-grid">

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Perceivable</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Non-text & multimedia content must have 
        <span class="hl">Alt text</span> or captions
      </li>
      <li>
        Content can be presented in different ways without
        <span class="hl">losing meaning</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        Easier to <strong>see & hear</strong> content using 
        <span class="hl">assistive technologies</span> (screen readers, text-to-speech browsers)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Operable</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Features which are usable using a 
        <span class="hl">keyboard and mouse</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        Users get <strong>enough time</strong> to read and interact
      </li>
      <li>
        Content must not cause 
        <span class="hl">seizures</span> or physical reactions
      </li>
      <li>
        Helps users <span class="hl">navigate</span> and find content easily
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Understandable</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Text should be 
        <span class="hl">readable and simple</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        Pages behave in 
        <span class="hl">predictable</span> ways
      </li>
      <li>
        Helps users avoid mistakes and 
        <span class="hl">fix errors</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Robust</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Works with <span class="hl">current and future</span> tools
      </li>
      <li>
        Compatible with different browsers and assistive technologies
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
