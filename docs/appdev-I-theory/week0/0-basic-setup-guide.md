# Basic setup guide

Hello! In this module, we will guide you through the basic setup and use of the tools required for this course. 

::: tip **Disclaimer:**

 We strongly encourage you to practice the course content on a laptop and not rely on a smartphone.

:::

## 1. Python

In this course, we will use the Python programming language for application development. Python is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** known for its simplicity and readability.

### Why Python

- Easy to learn and use.
- Extensive libraries and frameworks.
- Cross-platform compatibility.
- Strong community support.
- Versatile and can be used for <span style="color:rgb(98, 151, 208)"> web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation,and more</span>

### Installation of Python

1. Open a browser and visit the official Python downloads page: [python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download and install the version for your operating system.
3. During installation, make sure to check the box that says **Add Python to PATH**.
4. After installation, open Command Prompt and type `python --version` -> verify if you see the installed Python version printed in the terminal.
5. If you see an error message, revisit the installation steps and ensure that Python is added to ["Path" environment variable](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/).

## 2. Virtual Environments

Virtual environments are isolated environments that allow you to manage dependencies for different projects separately. This helps to avoid conflicts between packages required by different projects.

#### Creating a virtual environment

To create a virtual environment, open Command Prompt (or a terminal) and navigate to your project directory. Then run the following command:

```bash
python -m venv env_name

# If python does not work try:
py -m venv env_name

```

Replace `env_name` with the desired name for your virtual environment.

#### Activating a virtual environment

::: code-group

```bash [On Windows]
# enter following command in command prompt
.\env_name\Scripts\activate
```

```bash [On macOS and Linux]
# enter following command in terminal
source env_name/bin/activate
  ```
  
:::

#### Deactivating a virtual environment

To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run the following command:

```bash
deactivate
```

If you followed the steps correctly, you should see the virtual environment name in the Command Prompt/terminal, indicating that the virtual environment is active. <br>

### pip - Python package installer

### pip installation

`pip` is the package installer for Python. It is included by default with Python version 3.4 and above. To verify that `pip` is installed, open Command Prompt (or a terminal) and run `pip --version`.

#### Basic pip commands

| Task | Command |
|-----|---------|
| Install a package | `pip install package_name` |
| Uninstall a package | `pip uninstall package_name` |
| List installed packages | `pip freeze` |
| Upgrade a package | `pip install --upgrade package_name` |
| Install packages from a requirements file | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| Uninstall packages from a requirements file | `pip uninstall -r requirements.txt` |
| Show information about a package | `pip show package_name` |

For example, to install the Flask package, run:

```bash
pip install flask
```

::: info Make sure to activate your virtual environment before installing packages to ensure they are installed in the correct environment.
