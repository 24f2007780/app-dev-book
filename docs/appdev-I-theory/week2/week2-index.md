# Week 2
This week builds the **foundations of how content is represented and displayed on the Web**.


**CSS** controls visual styling with special focus on **selectors and specificity**, as these concepts determine  — a common source of confusion.

By the end of this week, you should be able to:
- Understand how text is encoded and stored in computers
- Convert numbers between different number systems, used internally by machines
- Write basic HTML to structure content
- *which CSS selector styles actually apply* by browser when multiple rules exist
