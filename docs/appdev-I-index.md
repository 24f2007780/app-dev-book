# Appdev I


Welcome to the Appdev I Theory documentation!
This course is designed for beginners who want to understand how web applications work from the ground up. Appdev I focuses on how applications are structured to how data flows between the browser (view), server, and database (model).

This course lays the conceptual foundation required courses such as Appdev II, where you will work with modern frontend frameworks and dive in detail on some concepts we touch upon here!!

<!-- 
- **Flask Configuration:** Discover the best practices for configuring your Flask applications, ensuring they are secure, scalable, and maintainable.
- **Flask Security:** Explore how to implement security features such as authentication and authorization in your Flask applications.
- **Flask SQLAlchemy:** Understand how to interact with databases using SQLAlchemy, an ORM for Python, and how to model your data effectively. -->

# [Project](./appdev-I-project/)

The Project section guides you through the practical application of the concepts learned in the Theory section. You'll work on a real-world project that will challenge you to apply your knowledge and skills. Topics covered include:

- **Problem Statement:** A detailed description of the project you will be working on, including the objectives and expected outcomes.
- **Checks Before Submission:** A checklist of tasks and criteria to ensure your project meets all the necessary requirements before submission.
- **Important Deadlines:** Key dates and deadlines you need to keep track of to stay on schedule.
- **Do's and Don'ts:** Best practices and common pitfalls to avoid during your project work.
- **Guidelines:** Detailed instructions and tips to help you successfully complete your project.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

- Gained a strong understanding of web application development using Flask (backend) and basic HTML/CSS (frontend).
- Learned how to set up and configure a development environment tailored to your needs.
- Developed a solid grasp of security best practices in web applications.
- Built and deployed a functional web application, applying the concepts and skills acquired during the course.
- Understand basics of computer networking, client–server communication, github, testing and user interface heuristics
- Perform CRUD operations via different HTTP methods.

## Additional Resources

For supplementary learning, you can explore the following:
